# Scientific Computing with Python - Certification

This repository contains my solutions to the challenges required by the Scientific Computing with Python certification from FreeCodeCamp
In each directory, you can find the project associated to each challenge in particular and also the challenge details and requirements.

As a personal input regarding this certification, I feel that the coding problems are walking anyone who tries to get this certificate through almost every aspect of Python, such as string manipulation, working with classes and also challenging people's logics.
