# Scientific Computing with Python - Certification

This repository contains my solutions to the challenges required by the Scientific Computing with Python certification from FreeCodeCamp

In each directory, you can find the solution source code associated to each challenge and also the challenge details and requirements.

Due to my interest in Python, I thought to give this certification a try and as a personal input I find this certification very useful for people who want to learn Python.

The challenges treat subjects as low to medium in difficulty, such as string manipulation, understanding Python data types and working with classes.
